# Loop Secure

Native Android customer and administrator apps, a Cloudflare-hosted administrator website, and an existing Supabase cloud backend for consented device-owner enrollment and phone-finance management.

- [Administrator website](https://loop-secure-admin.loopsecure-bacanyclinda.workers.dev) — Cloudflare Access sign-in with the configured owner email.
- [APK and Windows update downloads](https://github.com/basanisilinda-crypto/Bacy/releases/tag/loop-secure-v0.12.1).
- Customer app **0.12.1**, administrator app **1.5.0**. Android 11/API 30 minimum; target/compile Android 16/API 36. Compatibility on each handset still needs testing.

## Phone setup

Create or reopen the intended customer in the dashboard and download its fresh Windows enrollment ZIP. Extract it into its own folder, connect one authorized phone, and run `Enroll-Windows.cmd`. The helper finds Google Platform Tools, verifies the exact selected phone and actual device-owner/admin state, and starts customer connection only when verified. New enrollment codes expire after 30 minutes. Installation alone does not assign device ownership.

Android can refuse ownership when accounts or another device owner exist. Back up/sync phone data and confirm credentials before changing accounts. The helper never resets the phone or removes accounts. If ownership cannot be verified, inspect `Ownership-check.txt`; repeated downloads do not repair an unreadable local account or a permission failure.

Already-enrolled phones use the Windows **update** ZIP, preserving the signing identity, customer connection and device owner. A released test handset requires completed release and removal of the old local app before a new enrollment record; preserve the old payment and audit history.

## Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `android/app` | Signed native customer app and device-owner policies |
| `android/admin` | Native administrator app |
| `android/shared-ui` | Shared design and bundled fonts/logo |
| `cloud-api` | Supabase Edge Function and database sources |
| `cloudflare-admin` | Cloudflare Access-protected website and deployment configuration |
| `backend` | Optional Python/local server and shared website assets |
| `deployment/usb` | Windows enrollment and update helpers |
| `docs` | Hosting, EFT, enrollment and handset verification guidance |

## Build and deployment

Use JDK 17+ and Android SDK 36. In `android/`, run `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease :app:lintRelease :app:testDebugUnitTest` with the private signing environment configured as documented in `deployment/README.md`. Signing keys and runtime credentials are supplied separately and are never committed. Debug builds cannot update a release installation.

For the website, follow `cloudflare-admin/README.md`; dependencies are pinned and locked. `npm ci`, `npm test` and `npm run build` generate and verify the deployable Worker. Keep the backend administrator token in Cloudflare secrets. The new website switches future native-admin pairing links only after a valid owner loads the real customer register successfully; the existing site remains a fallback.

## Payments and device controls

EFT claims require bank-settlement verification before administrator approval. A submitted reference is not proof of payment. Approved payments, grace periods, manual controls and permanent release produce signed authorizations; requested changes and actual handset acknowledgements are shown separately. Automatic EFT verification and outbound payment emails require separately configured providers and credentials.

Banking and emergency access remain part of the managed flow. Device-owner restrictions use supported Android APIs; recovery/firmware protection and instantaneous delivery on every manufacturer are not guaranteed. Offline reboot behavior and banking app compatibility require the handset checks in `docs/HANDSET_TESTS.md`.

## This publication

Includes corrected USB ownership diagnostics and six administrator conveniences: keyboard customer search, remembered page, offline status, refresh time, copyable references and customer CSV export with spreadsheet-formula escaping. No customer records or private enrollment codes are included.

Verified before publication: signed APK identity/checksum, Android release lint and 30 unit cases, 20 actual PowerShell parser cases, Cloudflare JWT/relay tests, build dry run and protected public sign-in redirects. Physical enrollment and first owner sign-in remain handset/browser acceptance steps.
